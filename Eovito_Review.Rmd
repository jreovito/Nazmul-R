# I believe this code was written very well. 
# The data inspection component was thoroughly done, and I think you discovered a lot of good information about the file content you were examining. 
# As for the data processing section, I think this was also done very well. Your lines of code were well annotated, so I was able to follow exactly what you were doing without trouble.
# The only recommendation that I would have is to maybe annotate your for-loops a bit more so that the reader understands exactly what is going on if they have no background in R programming.
# Overall, there isnâ€™t anything drastic that I would change or add, as I believe you covered everything that the Professors were looking for.
